    <p><h1>Alena Borisenko's Short Biography</h1></p>
    <p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2></p>
    <p>"I was born in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia, but at the age of 6, I moved to Moscow. I attended Lomonosov Private School from elementary school all the way until highschool graduation there. I applied to Tufts university with an initial interest in Biology.</p>

    <p><h2>College Education</h2></p>
    <p>At Tufts University, I discovered an interest in Computer Science. I had no prior experience in CS, so initially I took it simply out of curiosity and as an alternative to the required math courses. I noticed that I enjoyed my CS courses a lot more than my Biology classes, so I declared as a Computer Science Major during my Sophomore year.</p>
    <p>In addition, at Tufts I was able to fulfill my longtime dream of studying Japanese language. After 4 semesters of studying the language, I was able to study abroad at Kansai Gaidai in Hirakata-shi, Japan, which was one of the best experiences of my life. Upon my return to Tufts, I continued studying Japanese alongside Computer Science and declared as a Japanese Minor.</p>

    <p><h2>Future Plans</h2></p>
    <p>This fall, I will be continuing my studies towards a Master's degree in Computer Science at the Tufts Graduate School of Engineering.</p>
