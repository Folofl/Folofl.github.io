# Description:    Set of portfolio pages created as part of a Comp20 lab. 

# To my knowledge, everything works as intended: 
#    by going to https://folofl.github.io/ you will find a picture of "me,"
#    and two links leading to separate resume and bio pages
#
#    the css is not all that pretty, but everything is colored/positioned
#    as intended

# Collaboration:
#    I have posted a question on Piazza regarding use of <br/> <hr/> and &nbsp;
#    Followed advice posted by TA John Gallagher and instructor Ming Chow
#    Thank you both for your help!
#
#    I ended up using a simpler method for indent (didn't need overhand after all)
#    and used <br/> to space out some elements within the HTML

# I have spent approximately 3 hours on this assignment
