        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>My name is Alena and I am a software developer on the TrakCare Medication Management team at InterSystems.</p>
        </br>
        <p>I am originally from Russia, but I have lived in Boston for several years now -- throughout my studies at Tufts University and as I continue to work in the area.</p>

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>Before declaring as a Computer Science major during my undergraduate studies, I was actually planning to major in Biology. However, after spontaneously taking a few Computer Science classes I quickly fell in love with programming and decided to make the switch.</p>
        </br>
        <p>While I do not have a particular favorite sub-field of Computer Science, I enjoy creating programs, websites and applications that are used in research, health care, education and daily life in general.</p>
        </br>
        <p>In addition to programming, I am interested in research and Japanese Language, and I am excited to work on challenges that involve one of or maybe even combine several of those interests.</p>

        <h2>Just for Fun</h2>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, crafting, and reading science fiction novels and detective stories. I have listed some additional details below if you want to know more!</p>
